Machine Learning 
Definition: 
1959: Field of stufy that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
1998: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measures by P, improves with experience E.
Example: playing checkers.
E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
T = the task of playing checkers.
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
Supervised learning
Unsupervised learning.

Supervised learning： regression and classification
Unsupervised learning: Octave开发工具，并没有设置输出的结果集，根据输入自动进行分类
    聚类算法cluster，得出的结果不会反馈给输入，基因图谱自动分类
    非聚类算法 在输入中得到某种数据格式，鸡尾酒宴会中分离声音


回归问题
回归模型定义了输入与输出的关系，输入即现有知识，而输出则为预测
积累知识： 我们将储备的知识称之为训练集 Training Set，很好理解，知识能够训练人进步
学习：学习如何预测，得到输入与输出的关系。合适的指导方针我们称之为学习算法 Learning Algorithm
预测.
